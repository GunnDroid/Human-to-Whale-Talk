Title: Whale Talk | English to Whale Translator

Description: This is the Whale Talk web app README file.
This project is part of a Javascript course from Codecademy.com.

This original course only contained the building of the javascript file. I've connected this file to a HTML and CSS to create a working webpage with styles, a gif and even background whale sounds!

This project takes an input value from a text box and when submitted the "getInputValue()" function is called. This function recognizes only the vowel values by iterating through an array. Once it finds the vowels, it doubles the "e" and "u" values and then returns the array as a string.

This string is then added to the HTML document in the "translatedText" <p> element.
